baseline
- MLP is used not relative to the object centroid
1) Non Recurrent Graph(half_body, objects, missing_object)
2) remaining_joints = MLP(half_body_node)

grabnet
1) f1 = subtract obj_xyz by obj_pos
2) f2 = concatenate [f1, half_body]
3) remaining_joints = MLP(f2) + obj_pos

components
- components specific to the project



v1
- grabnet predict finger joints
- grabnet predict missing arm given masked data where the data has been xy centered
- why did this detached version not work ... ? its probably working as best as it can
  - wrists are still not strongly attached to the object
  - another problem is that it can potentially overfit - because the grab_net receives the novel output from the decoder where the markers diverge after some frames

v2
- 

v2 ( in old folder)
- grabnet predict wrist** and finger joints given the xyz centered object
- grabnet predict missing arm* given masked data where the data has been xy centered
- not good because when it creates extreme wrist bends when i replace the wrist portion of * with **
  - current results still show the wrist drifting apart from the objects because of the overwhelming decoder losses so retrain the detached version

v3 (in old folder)
- grabnet predict wrist* and finger joints given the xyz centered object
- grabnet predict missing arm given masked data where the data has been xy centered and where the wrists have been filled in by *
  - build this detached version
